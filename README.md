# Audi MMI Video convertor
This utility is made to convert any video file in to the correct size and format for Audi's 3G+ MMI dashboard system (designed for Q5 display, but should work on others).  I used the information on [this forum thread](http://www.myaudiq5.com/index.php/topic/21721-would-anyone-mind-trying-this-video-file-on-their-q5-with-mmi-plus/) to try to get the right settings.

It includes the Progress bar from [http://0xcc.net/ruby-progressbar/index.html.en](http://0xcc.net/ruby-progressbar/index.html.en) and uses Open3 code for forking and progress from [https://github.com/streamio/streamio-ffmpeg](https://github.com/streamio/streamio-ffmpeg).
